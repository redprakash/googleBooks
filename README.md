# Google Books

Google Books UI

> MVP:

- [x] Create a page that allows users to search for books
- [x] Page should include the following:
  - [x] Header section introducing the page
  - [x] Form containing a text input and a submit / search button
  - [x] A grid of books

> Instructions:

- [x] When the submit button is clicked you need the request books from the Google books API using the input value as your query string
- [x] The books that you receive should be rendered in the books grid.
- [x] Each book in the grid should have an image, author, title and description
- [x] The grid should be responsive on different screen sizes
- [x] You should use async / await for your request code, NOT .then

> Styling (required):

- [x] This application should look good, take some time to pick a palette and plan out your design. You can use tools like Figma or wireframe pro to plan what your application is going to look like.
- [x] Styling must use BEM, and each block should have its own SCSS file
- [x] Your palette should use variables

> Application Design (required):

- [x] You should separate DOM functions and non-DOM functions in different modules
- [ ] Write as many non-DOM functions as you can
- [ ] Functions should do 1 thing, and should be as pure and reusable as possible
- [x] Always use iterators over loops
- [ ] Always parametrize and abstract large pieces of duplicate code.

> Bonus (optional, but highly recommended):

- [ ] Give feedback to the user when no book results can be found for the query.
- [ ] When a user clicks a book in the grid, a modal should appear with more book information, think about release, publish date, country, languages, etc.
